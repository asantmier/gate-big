B.I.G. Gun is a 2D visual puzzle role playing game where you take the role of an AI controlled gun guarding the intergalatic border checkpoint: the B.I.G. Gate. Use your scanner to look inside ships and make sure nobody is breaking the daily law set by your owners, because its your job to kill anyone who breaks the law even if it means killing an entire ship full of potentially innocent people in the process. Refuse to be a good tool in the hands of your masters and face destruction, or follow the rules and get promoted.

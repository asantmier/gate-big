You have been assigned as a probationary agent for B.I.G. For the next 5 days, you will be \
inspecting ships trying to enter the planet KA-414 to ensure they abide our ever changing laws. \
Each ship will provide a Manifest detailing the amount of passengers and cargo they carry. Ensure the manifest is correct.
Use the Life and Cargo scanner to make sure that these ships are carrying exactly what \
they claim. No more, no less. 
If a ship follows the law, turn the key and press the Blue Button. If they \
do not, turn the key and press the Red Button to annihilate them with the B.I.G. Gun.
You have limited room for error.\n
Secure the Empire, and make the Empire Great Again!
